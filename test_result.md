# Test Results - Appointment Management System

## Original User Problem Statement
The user requested that when an appointment is cancelled, it should be **completely removed** from both Airtable and the dashboard's calendar view, rather than merely being marked as "Cancelled".

## Current Implementation Status
- **Backend**: FastAPI server with DELETE endpoint for complete appointment removal
- **Frontend**: Next.js calendar with cancel functionality that triggers complete deletion
- **Database**: Airtable integration with proper delete operations

## Testing Protocol
1. **Backend Testing First**: Always test backend endpoints before frontend
2. **Frontend Testing**: Only test frontend with explicit user permission
3. **Test Focus**: Complete deletion workflow - appointments should be removed from both Airtable and calendar
4. **Never Fix Already Fixed Issues**: Don't duplicate work done by testing agents

## Backend Testing Requirements
- Test DELETE endpoint `/api/appointments/{appointment_id}`
- Test UPDATE endpoint `/api/appointments/{appointment_id}` with action='cancel'
- Verify records are completely removed from Airtable
- Test error handling for invalid appointment IDs
- Verify all existing CRUD operations still work

## Frontend Testing Requirements (User Permission Required)
- Test cancel button functionality in calendar
- Verify confirmation dialog appears
- Test complete deletion workflow
- Verify calendar updates in real-time after deletion
- Test appointment creation and editing still work

## Test Results Summary
*Results will be updated by testing agents*

## Issues Found and Fixed
*Issues will be logged here as they are discovered and resolved*

## Incorporate User Feedback
- Always follow user's specific requirements
- Don't make assumptions about desired behavior
- Ask for clarification when requirements are unclear
- Test exactly what the user requested

## Next Steps
1. Backend testing for complete deletion functionality
2. User permission for frontend testing
3. Address any issues found during testing
