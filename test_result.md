## Test Results Summary

### Backend Testing (Completed ‚úÖ)
- DELETE endpoint `/api/appointments/{appointment_id}` - ‚úÖ Working correctly
- UPDATE endpoint with `action: 'cancel'` - ‚úÖ Working correctly  
- Error handling for invalid appointment IDs - ‚úÖ Working correctly
- GET `/api/records` endpoint - ‚úÖ Working correctly
- Regular appointment updates (non-cancel) - ‚úÖ Working correctly
- Dropdown data endpoints (clients, services, employees) - ‚úÖ Working correctly
- Airtable connection and health check - ‚úÖ Working correctly

**NEW BOOKING ADMIN ENDPOINTS:**
- GET `/api/employee-availability` - ‚úÖ Working correctly
- GET `/api/services-with-duration` - ‚úÖ Working correctly  
- GET `/api/therapists-by-service/{service_name}` - ‚úÖ Working correctly
- Error handling for invalid service names - ‚úÖ Working correctly

**Key Finding**: Both deletion methods completely remove appointments from Airtable, and deleted appointments no longer appear in subsequent GET requests. The complete deletion functionality is working as requested.

**New Key Finding**: All new booking admin endpoints are working perfectly. Employee availability returns 6 employees with complete data (availability days, expertise, contact info). Services endpoint returns 31 services with pricing and duration. Therapist filtering correctly matches expertise with service names - found qualified therapists for Haircut(2), Massage(1), Facial(3), Coloring(2), Styling(2). Data structure matches expected format for admin booking interface.

### Frontend Testing (Completed ‚úÖ)
- Cancel button functionality in calendar - ‚úÖ Working correctly
- Confirmation dialog for appointment cancellation - ‚úÖ Working correctly  
- Real-time calendar updates after deletion - ‚úÖ Working correctly
- Calendar interface and appointment display - ‚úÖ Working correctly
- Appointment detail and edit modals - ‚úÖ Working correctly
- Add appointment functionality - ‚úÖ Working correctly

**Key Finding**: The complete deletion workflow is fully functional. Cancelled appointments are permanently removed from both the calendar interface and Airtable, with proper user confirmation, real-time updates, and success feedback. All existing functionality remains intact.
