The previous AI engineer successfully migrated a Next.js application to a FastAPI backend for Airtable. Initial work focused on comprehensive CRUD operations for appointments and establishing robust environment configurations. Subsequently, the engineer built advanced admin features, including a service-therapist availability system and an employee management section. Key challenges involved accurate data synchronization, especially for linked records and multi-select fields, and persistent backend update errors. The engineer demonstrated iterative problem-solving, enhancing UI/UX for an Apple-like design. Most recently, the focus shifted from a dynamic analytics dashboard to refining employee management to incorporate new Airtable Services fields, and then implementing intricate visual enhancements like animated glow effects. The last major effort involved debugging persistent  errors, linked record issues, and finally, initiating Wassenger/Pusher integration for real-time conversations.

<product_requirements>
The application's core purpose is to integrate a Next.js dashboard with Airtable via a FastAPI backend, enabling bi-directional CRUD with real-time synchronization. This evolved into several key features:
1.  **Comprehensive FastAPI API**: Endpoints for appointments, clients, services, and employees.
2.  **Full Appointment Management**: CRUD operations via calendar, including deletion.
3.  **Booking Admin Interface**: Admin interface for service-therapist cross-referencing, showing availability and suggesting alternative slots.
4.  **Comprehensive Employee Management System**:
    *   Apple-like UI/UX: clickable cards, hidden delete, schedule, service assignments, and profile picture upload.
    *   Handle  (broad categories) and  (specific services), with  being prominent.
    *   Animated light glow around employee cards changing color based on .
5.  **Dynamic Analytics Dashboard**: Real-time, 100% accurate KPIs (revenue, appointments, clients, services, employees) with dynamic time-period filtering and accurate growth, new/returning client, and retention calculations.
6.  **Real-time Conversations (New Request)**: Integrate Wassenger (WhatsApp API) with Pusher for real-time messaging capabilities within the conversation tab.

<code_architecture>
The project is structured into  (FastAPI) and  (Next.js) directories.



-   ****:
    -   **Summary**: Main FastAPI application.
    -   **Changes**: Extensive modifications for:
        *   **Employee Management**: Robust PUT, POST, GET operations for employees, handling fields like ,  (linked records), , , . Fixed mapping issues, specifically  field recognition and handling Airtable's computed fields (Full Name, Employee ID). Logic added to convert service IDs to names for retrieval and names to IDs for updates, handling newlines/spacing in service names, and ensuring unique service IDs for Airtable.
        *   **Analytics**: New  endpoint for dynamic real-time data.
        *   **Wassenger/Pusher Integration**: Added  endpoint to send WhatsApp messages via Wassenger, and  to receive incoming messages/events, integrating with Pusher for real-time frontend updates. Defined Pydantic models for message payloads. Configured Pusher client.
-   ****:
    -   **Summary**: Stores Airtable and MongoDB credentials.
    -   **Changes**: Updated with user-provided .
-   ****:
    -   **Summary**: Configures Next.js proxy rules.
    -   **Changes**: Confirmed for correct proxying.
-   ****:
    -   **Summary**: Stores .
    -   **Changes**: Updated for local proxy usage.
-   ****:
    -   **Summary**: Dedicated employee management page.
    -   **Changes**: Heavily refactored for Apple-like UI/UX. Implemented animated glow effects based on employee status (Active/Inactive/On Leave) with subtle traveling light animations. Refined display of  (prominent) vs.  (smaller). Enhanced error handling to show detailed backend messages. Added  and cache-busting to ensure real-time data refresh after updates, specifically for  field, and implemented client-side logic to prevent sending duplicate service IDs.
-   ****:
    -   **Summary**: Newly created analytics dashboard.
    -   **Changes**: Transformed into a fully functional dashboard, fetching data from  with dynamic time-period filtering.
-   ****:
    -   **Summary**: Conversation interface.
    -   **Changes**: Prepared for real-time messaging integration, likely to consume Pusher events and send messages via backend. (Initial mock data).
-   ****:
    -   **Summary**: Global CSS styles.
    -   **Changes**: Added CSS for animated glow effects (, ).
-   ****:
    -   **Summary**: Frontend dependencies.
    -   **Changes**: Added  for real-time frontend integration.

<pending_tasks>
-   Further refine the No Available Bookings Today and alternative availability display logic in the booking admin page, including displaying alternative slots for 24 hours before/after.
-   Update the Booking Admin system to use the new  field for matching therapists to services instead of .
-   Complete the frontend integration for the Wassenger/Pusher real-time conversation system.

<current_work>
The most immediate work involved integrating Wassenger (WhatsApp API) with Pusher for real-time messaging within the application's Conversations tab.
The AI engineer has:
1.  **Added the Wassenger API key** () to the backend's  file for secure configuration.
2.  **Installed necessary Python packages** (, ) in the backend to enable API calls to Wassenger and Pusher.
3.  **Modified **:
    *   Initialized the Pusher client.
    *   Defined Pydantic models (, ) for request/response payloads.
    *   Created a  endpoint to send messages via Wassenger.
    *   Created a  endpoint to receive incoming Wassenger webhook events and push them to the frontend via Pusher.
4.  **Modified **: Added  as a dependency for the frontend to consume real-time messages.

The current state is that the backend infrastructure for Wassenger and Pusher is set up, and the frontend has the necessary library installed. The user's last message () indicates they are awaiting instructions on how to proceed with or test the newly integrated conversation feature, possibly expecting specific input for testing or further setup. The frontend () still uses mock data and needs to be updated to consume the real-time data streams.
