The previous AI engineer successfully migrated an existing Next.js application to a new FastAPI backend for Airtable integration. Initial efforts focused on establishing CRUD operations for appointments, addressing environment variables, CORS, and complex Airtable field mapping. Subsequent work expanded to building comprehensive admin features, including a service-therapist availability system and a robust employee management section. Key challenges involved accurate data synchronization, especially for linked records and multi-select fields (e.g., 'expertise' vs. 'services'), and resolving persistent backend update errors. The engineer demonstrated iterative problem-solving, enhancing UI/UX for an Apple-like design. Most recently, the focus shifted to developing a real-time, dynamic analytics dashboard with 100% accurate data, followed by refining employee management UI to incorporate new Airtable Services fields, and finally, implementing intricate visual enhancements like animated glow effects.

The initial goal was to integrate an existing React/Next.js dashboard with Airtable via a FastAPI backend, enabling bi-directional CRUD operations for records with configurable credentials and real-time synchronization. This evolved significantly to include:
- Comprehensive FastAPI API endpoints for appointments, clients, services, and employees.
- Full CRUD for appointments via calendar, including complete deletion.
- An intuitive admin interface for service-therapist cross-referencing, showing availability based on service and time. This needs refinement to differentiate no qualified therapists from no available bookings and suggest alternative 24hr slots.
- A comprehensive employee management system with Apple-like UI/UX: clickable cards, hidden delete, schedule, service assignments, and profile picture upload with persistence. The system now must handle two employee fields:  (broad categories) and  (specific services), with  being prominent.
- A fully dynamic analytics dashboard providing real-time, 100% accurate KPIs for revenue, appointments, clients, services, and employees. This dashboard must dynamically filter all data based on a single time selector (Today, Last 7 Days, Last Month, Last 3 Months, Last 6 Months, Yearly), with accurate growth, new/returning client, and retention calculations.
- Visual enhancements for employee cards, including an animated light glow around the card whose color changes based on employee status.

<code_architecture>
The project is structured into  (FastAPI) and  (Next.js) directories.



-   ****:
    -   **Summary**: Core FastAPI application, handling all Airtable API interactions. It defines Pydantic models and implements CRUD endpoints for various entities.
    -   **Changes**: Extensive modifications. Implemented  to handle  and  fields, including mapping frontend service names to Airtable  values. Enhanced  to include , , , and to convert  IDs to names, cleaning up extra characters. Added a new  endpoint to fetch and process comprehensive real-time data for revenue, appointments, clients, services, and employee performance, with dynamic time-period filtering. Debugged and fixed  imports and list-type field handling ( linked record).
-   ****:
    -   **Summary**: Stores Airtable API key, base ID, and table name for secure configuration.
    -   **Changes**: Updated as needed with user-provided credentials.
-   ****:
    -   **Summary**: Configures Next.js proxy rules to direct  requests to the backend.
    -   **Changes**: Modified to ensure correct proxying to .
-   ****:
    -   **Summary**: Stores  for frontend API calls.
    -   **Changes**: Updated to  for local proxy usage.
-   ****:
    -   **Summary**: Displays appointments and handles CRUD operations.
    -   **Changes**: Modified to integrate with the FastAPI backend for data fetching, creation, update, and deletion.
-   ****:
    -   **Summary**: Displays client data.
    -   **Changes**: Updated to use the new backend URL and proxy.
-   ****:
    -   **Summary**: A newly created page for admin booking, selecting services, and viewing therapist availability.
    -   **Changes**: Created to implement service-therapist cross-referencing. Pending further refinement of availability logic.
-   ****:
    -   **Summary**: Dedicated page for comprehensive employee management.
    -   **Changes**: Heavily rewritten to implement Apple-like UI/UX for employee cards, an edit modal for schedules, service assignments, and profile pictures. Key changes involved handling the  field mapping issue and then adapting to the new  field from Airtable, displaying services prominently and expertise smaller. Also updated status badge styling and started implementing an animated glow effect.
-   ****:
    -   **Summary**: Newly created page for displaying business analytics.
    -   **Changes**: Transformed from a coming soon placeholder into a fully functional dashboard. Implemented fetching data from the new  endpoint. Designed to dynamically display total revenue, appointments, clients, top services, and top performers, all filtered by a single time period selector. Updated TypeScript interfaces to match backend data.
-   ****:
    -   **Summary**: Main dashboard page.
    -   **Changes**: Updated to redirect internal references from the old  route to the new  route.

<current_work>
Immediately before this summary, the AI engineer had successfully implemented a comprehensive and dynamic analytics dashboard. This dashboard now fetches 100% real data from Airtable, including total revenue, total appointments, total clients, top services, and top performers. All metrics dynamically adjust based on a single time-period selector (Today, Last 7 Days, Last Month, Last 3 Months, Last 6 Months, Yearly). Critically, accurate calculations for new/returning clients, client retention, and revenue growth (comparing current vs. previous periods) were implemented.

Following this, the user requested an update to the employee management system's UI to align with a new Airtable structure: employees now have a distinct  field (specific services) in addition to  (broad categories). The AI engineer updated the backend () to expose the  field and convert service IDs to names. The frontend () was then refactored to prominently display  on employee cards and within the edit modal, with  displayed smaller. Additionally, the engineer enhanced the visual styling of employee status badges to have better contrast and a subtle shadow.

The very last task being worked on is a visual enhancement: implementing an animated light glow around each employee card that changes color based on the employee's  (Active, Inactive, On Leave), similar to a chat interface's effect. The engineer has added a CSS class () and initiated updates to the employee card to apply this dynamic border color.
